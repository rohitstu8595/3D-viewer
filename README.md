# Javascript 3D Model Viewer 

A web viewer to display 3D models in the browser.

[Demo](https://cgwire.github.io/js-3d-model-viewer/)


## How to run

Get this library as a dependency:

```bash
npm install js-3d-model-viewer
```

Then run this snippet after the HTML of your page is loaded:

```javascript
import modelPlayer from 'js-3d-model-viewer'
const viewerElement = document.getElementById('viewer')
const opts = {
  grid: true,
  trackball: false
}
const scene = modelPlayer.prepareScene(viewerElement, opts)
modelPlayer.loadObject(scene, './assets/sample.obj') // Urls are fine here.
// Alternatively you can load a .glb file
modelPlayer.loadGlb(scene, './assets/sample.glb') // Urls are fine here.
```

You're done!

If you want to go fullscreen, you can do it like this:

```javascript
const viewerElement = document.getElementById('viewer')
const fullScreenButton = document.getElementById('fullscreen-button')
fullScreenButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  modelPlayer.goFullScreen(viewerElement)
})
```

If you want to enable the underlying Thee.js cache:

```
modelPlayer.enableCache()
// modelPlayer.disableCache()
```

## Development status

* Currently the viewer supports only `.obj` and `.glb` files.
* Unit tests are missing


## Technologies

This viewer is based on [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)


## Development environment

First install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

All the code is in the `src/index.js` file. Once you did your changes you have to run the dev build:

```
npm run dev
```

Then you can test it with the demo page by starting a static webserver:

```
npm run serve
```

You can see the result in the browser by connecting to
[http://localhost:9080](http://localhost:9080).

To build the projects for production you have to run the following command:

```
npm run build
```
#thank you for giving us your pecious time...

You will obtained a minified version of the sources in the `dist` folder.
